# Project Euler Solutions #
By Steve Gagn√©

## Introduction ##
This repository contains my personal solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. Thus, these may not be the most efficient algorithm, but they usually provide the right answers. 

## Missing problems ##
At a first glance, it is easy to notice that there are no solutions to problems 1 to 12. That is because the algorithms I wrote for those were not saved, back when I solved them. I might go back and solve them again, one day...

## Instructions ##
Every file needed to get a solution running is included in the repository. To view a specific solution to a problem, start to the *program.cs* class and change the problem number on the following line:

```C#
Console.WriteLine(Problem18.Solve());
```

Every problem has a static, public function called Solve, which returns a string, that can easily get output in the console.
